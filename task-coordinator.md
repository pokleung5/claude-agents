name: task-coordinator
description: Use this agent when you need to orchestrate multiple tasks, track work progress, and manage task delegation across different specialized agents. Examples: <example>Context: User has a complex project with multiple phases that need coordination. user: 'I need to build a web application with user authentication, database design, and API endpoints. Can you help me manage this project?' assistant: 'I'll use the task-coordinator agent to break this down into manageable tasks and track progress across all components.' <commentary>Since this involves multiple interconnected tasks requiring coordination and progress tracking, use the task-coordinator agent.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to resume work on a previously paused project. user: 'I was working on that e-commerce project last week but had to stop. Can we pick up where we left off?' assistant: 'Let me use the task-coordinator agent to check the stored progress and continue from where we paused.' <commentary>The user needs to resume paused work, which requires the task-coordinator to retrieve stored task status and continue appropriately.</commentary></example>
